# mechanical-daemon.sh — one processing tick over the relay recipe drop-dir (id:b3d0, A3;
# meeting 2026-07-02-1924 decision 3). The host `--user` `.path`-unit target: runs
# relay-authored recipes OUTSIDE the Workflow (pure mechanical script → no permission wall).
#
# For each recipe JSON in pending/:
#   1. VALIDATE (recipe-validate.sh). Invalid recipes are NEVER silently dropped — moved to
#      rejected/ with a loud sibling .error file and a log line (no-silent-swallow, id:4347).
#   2. HOST GATE (id:9cfa): a recipe's `host` field binds it to a specific machine (mirrors the
#      `[host:<name>]` ROADMAP tag). REUSES `host-gate.sh` (never a raw uname compare) by
#      synthesizing the `[host:<name>]` tag text it expects. CHECK-AND-DEFER: on a host
#      mismatch (exit 3) the recipe is left untouched in pending/ — another host's daemon
#      owns it — and the reason is logged. This is a SAFETY gate, not a launch-capacity gate:
#      it runs before the intensity/resource checks below.
#   3. CHECK the launch gate: `relay-intensity.sh permits <est_wall> <resource>` AND
#      `resource-probe.sh <resource>` must BOTH succeed. CHECK-AND-DEFER, never preempt: if
#      either denies, the recipe is left in pending/ untouched (no artifact, no inject) and
#      the reason is logged. There is no third state — a denied recipe is retried next tick.
#   3b. REPO-LEASE GATE (id:0534, meeting mtg-1726 D5): a recipe's `cmd` writes its
#      acceptance_artifact INTO the target repo's checkout. If that repo carries a LIVE hard
#      lease (an executor/integrator merging its worktree into main), running now would dirty
#      the tree mid-merge and stall the --drain driver. PEEK-AND-DEFER via `claim.sh peek`
#      (non-consuming, LIVE-only): a leased target leaves the recipe in pending/ — symmetric
#      with the host/intensity defers.
#   4. On PERMIT: move pending → running, run `cmd` (which writes acceptance_artifact), move
#      running → done, and drop a review-request via `inject.sh add` so the pool reviews the
#      artifact. A `cmd` that fails still lands in done/ (with a sibling .error file) rather
#      than running/ — the daemon must never leave a permanently-"running" ghost — but does
#      NOT inject a review (nothing to review).
#
# Usage: mechanical-daemon.sh run|tick     perform ONE tick (run/tick are synonyms)
#
# Env overrides (hermetic testing — mirrors recipe-validate.sh / recipe-manifest.md):
#   RELAY_RECIPE_DIR    recipe root, default ~/.config/relay/recipes (holds pending/running/done/rejected)
#   RELAY_INTENSITY_FILE, CLAIM_BASE, CLAIM_LOG, INJECT_BASE, INJECT_LOG
#                       threaded straight to relay-intensity.sh / resource-probe.sh (via
#                       claim.sh) / inject.sh — this script never reads their state directly.
#   RELAY_HOSTNAME      threaded straight to host-gate.sh (its own override) — the "current
#                       host" for the host-binding gate; hermetic tests set this rather than
#                       depending on the real machine's hostname.
#
# Registry invariant (recipe-manifest.md): recipes are WHITELISTED/relay-authored only. This
# daemon NEVER scans ROADMAP.md/TODO.md to invent a recipe — it only ever consumes files
# already sitting in pending/.
