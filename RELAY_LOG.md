Worked id:44ba — added `> **Fable note:**` blockquote after the γ-branch reference table in `meeting/broker-mode.md` naming the inline-prose replacement for `AskUserQuestion` on Fable-class harnesses with a pointer to `format.md §Interactive mode §Harness-class gate`. Test `test_fable_caveat.sh` green; full suite 4 pass / 0 fail / 4 expected-red.
Friction: none.
