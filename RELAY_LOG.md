review 2026-06-12: id:7691 verified genuinely green (no gaming flags); test-integrity audit clean over 10 commits; suite 3 pass / 5 expected-red; ARCHITECTURE §10 + CLAUDE.md Layout/Testing synced; relay mirror count 6→7

Worked id:44ba — added `> **Fable note:**` blockquote after the γ-branch reference table in `meeting/broker-mode.md` naming the inline-prose replacement for `AskUserQuestion` on Fable-class harnesses with a pointer to `format.md §Interactive mode §Harness-class gate`. Test `test_fable_caveat.sh` green; full suite 4 pass / 0 fail / 4 expected-red.
Friction: none.

## 2026-06-12 — executor (Sonnet)

Worked id:2520 — added `humanize_tokens` helper to `statusline/statusline-command.sh` and changed `CONTEXT_DISPLAY` from bare `<pct>%` to `<pct>%(<tokens>)` where tokens are humanized: <1k plain, 1k–10k one decimal (e.g. `9.5k`), ≥10k integer (e.g. `115k`). Test `test_statusline_tokens.sh` green; full suite 5 pass / 0 fail / 3 expected-red.
Friction: none.

## 2026-06-12 — executor (Sonnet)

Worked id:32d6 — created `tools/ctx-budget.sh`: scans `*/SKILL.md` files, emits TSV `<relpath>\t<est_tokens>\t<gate>\t<OK|WARN>` (est=bytes/4, default gate 2000, CTX_BUDGET_GATE override), `--summary` mode shows only WARN lines plus total count, always exits 0. Test `test_ctx_budget.sh` green; full suite 6 pass / 0 fail / 2 expected-red.
Friction: none.

## 2026-06-12 — executor (Sonnet)

Worked id:1ec1 — added `fables-turn` and `projects` to the Makefile SKILLS list; defined per-skill `_FILES/_EXEC/_ALLOW/_LOCAL` variables; extended `SKILL_RULES install-*` to `mkdir -p` each file's dirname so nested `references/` and `scripts/` subdirs are created; added `trap '' PIPE || true` to `status-*` recipe to survive `grep -q` early pipe exit. `fables-turn_ALLOW` covers both scripts. Test `test_makefile_skills.sh` green; full suite 7 pass / 0 fail / 1 expected-red.
Friction: none.

## 2026-06-12 — executor (Sonnet)

Worked id:3b02 — added `say` subcommand to `meeting/broker-curl.sh`: reads stdin line-by-line with `while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]` (handles no-trailing-newline), skips empty lines, builds JSON per line with `jq -n --arg` (apostrophes/quotes/backslashes safe), first line gets `"kind":"opener"` when `--opener` passed as $4, curl redirects stdout to /dev/null with `--fail` so errors reach stderr. Updated `meeting/broker-mode.md` §Discussion example to use one `say` call per agenda item via `printf '%s\n' ... | broker-curl.sh say --opener`. Fixed a quoting bug in `tests/test_broker_say.sh`: the test used `'\''` inside a `$'...'` ANSI-C string which ended the ANSI-C context early, turning all subsequent `\n` into literal two-char sequences (only 1 real newline in the 4-line input). Changed to `\'` (valid inside `$'...'`); no assertions altered. Full suite 8 pass / 0 fail.
Friction: none.
