# Roadmap <!-- fables-turn roadmap v1 -->

Executor-facing task spec. Each item is sized for ONE Sonnet session. Items are
the single source of truth — TODO.md carries only a summary line. Executors tick
checkboxes; only the reviewer adds, removes, or re-scopes items.

Read `CLAUDE.md` (§Testing, §Gotchas, §Relay contract) before starting any item.
Done-check for every item: tick the item's checkbox below, then `make test` must
be fully green (see CLAUDE.md §Testing for the expected-red semantics).

## Items

### Pool-executable [HARD] — decided, needs per-item RED spec (route to handoff)

- [ ] [HARD] `/relay . --parallel N` — **[RE-FRAMED 2026-07-24, owner-directed: parallel fan-out is now pool `pipeline()` in the Workflow loop (id:1f4f), NOT the retired off-Workflow driver (id:93fe).

Promoted 2026-07-13 (user) from TODO id:e3c0 (single-id-two-views — same id spans both ledgers). **Why HARD** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/e3c0.md` <!-- id:e3c0 --> 🚧

## Handoff C2 2026-08-01 (relay handoff, owner-scoped 5-item promotion)

- [ ] [INPUT - meeting] **@container — relay children can write the target's MAIN checkout; "Work EXCLUSIVELY in that worktree" is prose with zero enforcement** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/f91a.md` <!-- children:d464,34b7 --> <!-- routed:f91a --> <!-- id:f91a -->


## Provision fail-open cluster 2026-08-11 (inbox `routed:8d64` + `routed:d9a5`; parent `id:f91a`, post-`id:34b7`)

- [ ] **[INPUT — decision]** Wire disjoint-greenlight.sh plan into the drain-mode fan-out planner — seam of id:ae08 (auto, id:3801) -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/02b2.md` <!-- relates:99e5 --> <!-- id:02b2 --> — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:decision-gate): Needs /meeting: per-unit file-set provenance + which same-repo units are concurrency-eligible under the review-barrier — else the greenlight call is a forbidden dead branch. — needs a /meeting
- [ ] **[INPUT — decision]** Route same-repo drain-mode integration through drain-integrate.sh (serialized one-writer safety net) (after id:<seam-1 id>) — seam of id:ae08 (auto, id:3801) -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/99e5.md` <!-- id:99e5 --> — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:decision-gate): Wiring drain-integrate.sh into relay-loop.js's shared integrate() path depends on seam-1 id:02b2 (decision-gated /meeting on drain-mode fan-out planner + review-barrier concurrency); acceptance invariant D3a undefinable until then, and done-check tests already pass so there is no RED guard for the guard-less core-loop change. — needs a /meeting
## Review-derived promotion 2026-08-14 (relay review, reverse-handoff §5b)

- [ ] [ROUTINE] **Parked-section vocab match is a bare substring — a heading that merely mentions `archive`/`done`/`gated`/etc. in descriptive prose parks its whole section** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/6446.md` 🚧 `@owner-gated` <!-- gated-on:f391 --> <!-- id:6446 -->

## Human triage 2026-08-19 (`/relay human .`, owner-decided)

## Parallel-suite flakiness — OBSERVE-FIRST (promoted from TODO 2026-08-21, `id:7518`)

- [ ] [INPUT - decision] **General parallel-suite flakiness — four unrelated tests have flaked in-suite and passed standalone; build the per-run failure logger before any fix** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/7518.md` <!-- id:7518 --> @container 🚧

## Integrator ledger staging + stale slicer wording (2026-08-21)

- [ ] **[INPUT — decision]** Gather post-id:81d5-fix flake-log confirmation runs at j1 and an over-subscribed width (e.g. j24/j32), ≥2 runs each — seam of id:7518 (auto, id:3801) -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/372a.md` <!-- id:372a --> — @container 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:hard-split): DECOMPOSED into seams id:97e0, id:f2ef, id:b1ef, id:c3be, id:6ab7 — pick those, not this. Each of 4 required flake-log runs (2× width=1, 2× width≥16) takes multiple minutes wall-clock; doesn't fit one executor turn as a single unit.
- [ ] **[HARD]** Reviewer: fold the three-width post-fix data into ROADMAP.md id:7518, rank surviving hypotheses with confirm/kill criteria each (Acceptance clause 4), and decide closure per clause 6/7 (after id:(depends on the data-gathering seam above)) — seam of id:7518 (auto, id:3801) -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/166a.md` <!-- id:166a -->

- [ ] **[INPUT — decision]** Summarize the 4 post-id:81d5 flake-log confirmation rows in RELAY_LOG.md (after id:all 4 run seams above) — seam of id:372a (auto, id:3801) -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/6ab7.md` <!-- id:6ab7 --> — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:human): only 3/4 required flake-log confirmation rows exist — 4th seam id:97e0 still gated on /relay human (width=1 run exceeds one turn's wall-clock budget) — needs /relay human

## Em-dash delimiter migration (owner-ratified, `docs/migration-em-dash-delimiter.md`) — S0..S10

- [x] [HARD] Em-dash delimiter migration S1 — flip `relay/references/hard-lanes.md` to hyphen delimiters, change all six scrape regexes (across `lane-convert.sh`, `roadmap-lint.sh`, `pre-commit-lane-vocab.sh`) to an explicit two-delimiter alternation, and DELETE all six hardcoded vocabulary fallbacks in favour of a loud non-zero exit; MUST land as one atomic commit (a split window makes the SSOT read new while readers silently enforce old). -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/71d6.md` <!-- gated-on:70bc --> <!-- id:71d6 -->
- [x] [HARD] Em-dash delimiter migration S2 — fix `gather-repo-state.sh`'s backwards lane-vocabulary map (`:337-351`) and its three `[INTENSIVE — ]` hardcodes (`:361/364/378`) to canonicalize on the hyphen spelling while accepting both delimiters on input; author the new RED spec pinning the canonical spelling (`tests/test_gather_lane_canonical_delimiter.sh` does not exist yet — writing it is part of this seam, and its RED evidence must be captured before the fix). -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/098a.md` <!-- gated-on:71d6 --> <!-- id:098a -->
- [x] [HARD] Em-dash delimiter migration S5 — convert the non-bash relay consumers (`relay-loop.js`, `drain.mjs`, `handback-guard.mjs`, `handback-followup.py`, `backtest-historical.py`) to the two-delimiter alternation; kept as a SEPARATE seam because a `relay-loop.js` template-string edit is the `loop-crash-class` runtime hazard that `node --check` + grep cannot catch — verify with the exec-smoke guard (id:5bac/aec5). -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/1a03.md` <!-- gated-on:2ee5 --> <!-- id:1a03 -->
- [x] [HARD] Em-dash delimiter migration S7 — flip the 26 NORMATIVE contract/doc markdown files (`relay/references/*.md`, `relay/SKILL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/diagrams/*.mmd`, `tracker/SCHEMA.md`, `hooks/lane-vocab.claude-rule.md`) to hyphen spelling while leaving every HISTORICAL doc (`docs/HANDOVER-*.md`, `docs/meeting-notes/**`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `*.archive.md` prose) byte-identical — distinguishing normative from historical is a judgment call per file, not a mechanical sweep, and rewriting a historical doc destroys the audit trail hazard 7 protects. -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/55c7.md` <!-- gated-on:2ee5 --> <!-- id:55c7 -->
- [x] [ROUTINE] Em-dash delimiter migration S8 — purely mechanical rewrite of the delimiter inside the 86 test-fixture files' heredocs and assertion strings, batched by prefix (`test_classify_*`, `test_gather_*`/`test_relay_*`, the rest, plus `tests/shard-canary/**` and `tracker/fixtures/**`); after EACH batch `tests/run-tests.sh` must read 519 passed / 0 failed / 1 expected-red plus the seam's own new specs — never open all 86 files in one turn. -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/ee31.md` <!-- gated-on:e8d4 --> <!-- gated-on:1a03 --> <!-- gated-on:d0aa --> <!-- gated-on:55c7 --> <!-- id:ee31 -->
- [ ] [HARD] Em-dash delimiter migration S9 — rewrite this repo's own LIVE lane tags in `TODO.md`/`ROADMAP.md`/`REVIEW_ME.md` and their `.archive.md` siblings to hyphen delimiters, through `meeting/md-merge.py` / `relay/scripts/commit-ledger.sh` only (never `Edit`/`sed -i` — these are shared non-union ledgers); per dc5b C2, this seam never runs concurrently with any other dotclaude-skills unit (one unit per repo per round). <!-- gated-on:ee31 --> — **MEASURED 2026-08-31** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/6958.md` [HARD - pool] [HARD] <!-- id:6958 -->
- [x] [INPUT - decision] **S9 archive conflict: the delimiter migration and the vocabulary ratchet cannot both be satisfied on `*.archive.md` without a ruling.** MEASURED 2026-08-31: migrating the 85 live lane tags in `ROADMAP.archive.md` (47) + `TODO.archive.md` (38) makes them ADDED lines carrying venue-keyed old vocabulary (`[HARD - pool]` x39, `[HARD - hands]` x6, `[HARD - decision gate]` x4), so `hooks/pre-commit-lane-vocab.sh` blocks both files (exit 1, verified with `LANE_VOCAB_ALL_REPOS=1`). ALL 85 are closed `- [x]` entries; zero are open. Three ways out, none takeable without you: (a) ** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/2065.md` <!-- gated-on:6958 --> <!-- id:2065 -->
- [ ] [INPUT - meeting] Em-dash delimiter migration S10 (seam B) — drop the dual-vocab tolerance fleet-wide: delete the em-dash arm of every alternation and turn a live old-delimiter/old-vocabulary lane tag into a LOUD (nonzero) error in `roadmap-lint.sh`, `gather-human-backlog.sh` and the ratchet; MUST NOT be bundled with anything else. -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/da55.md` <!-- gated-on:6958 --> <!-- id:da55 -->

- [ ] [INPUT - decision] **Three items carry a de-facto lane derived from BODY PROSE, which `classify-repo` reads as their real lane.** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/1254.md` <!-- relates:2d17 --> <!-- id:1254 -->

## 2026-09-04 handoff C2 -- ledger-tooling and test-harness defects from the 09-04 design day (run relay-20260904-145432-15472)

- [ ] [ROUTINE] 🔴 **`SH_ASSIGN_RE` truncates a multi-line shell assignment at the first quote, so a read's notes operand can vanish -- a corpus verdict the parser silently mis-reads, and the missed-union direction is the UNSAFE one the code itself names.** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/e047.md` <!-- children-of:1447 --> <!-- id:e047 -->
- [ ] [ROUTINE] **`cited_by`'s surviving-text escape is evaluated against the WRONG future state in a batch move, and it silenced `ledger-map.py:493` -- the very consumer that justified the 1447 untraced amendment.** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/0176.md` <!-- children-of:1447 --> <!-- id:0176 -->
- [ ] [ROUTINE] **The `id:b54b` hermeticity backstop fires on RELAY worktrees, so any `/relay` run concurrent with `make test` reports a false breach -- `.claude/worktrees/` is excluded for this exact reason and the relay root is not.** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/c132.md` <!-- id:c132 -->
- [ ] [ROUTINE] **`ledger-shrink.py` hoists an EXAMPLE marker quoted in prose as if it were real -- 30 lines, and it defeated the shrink on `ee62`.** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/8372.md` <!-- relates:14e5 --> <!-- id:8372 -->
- [ ] [ROUTINE] **Two tests flaked green-standalone/red-in-suite and neither is explained; `|| fail` after a grep cannot tell a FALSE assertion from a check that COULD NOT RUN (360 sites).** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/735f.md` <!-- id:735f -->
- [ ] [ROUTINE] **The note-header shrink is DELIVERED (255 B/note); what remains is the gate -- `id:03a3` must cite the measured per-note header cost before the 46-repo migration runs.** -- detail: `docs/ledger-notes/e567.md` <!-- relates:03a3 --> <!-- id:e567 -->
