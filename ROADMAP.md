# Roadmap <!-- fables-turn roadmap v1 -->

Executor-facing task spec. Each item is sized for ONE Sonnet session. Items are
the single source of truth — TODO.md carries only a summary line. Executors tick
checkboxes; only the reviewer adds, removes, or re-scopes items.

Read `CLAUDE.md` (§Testing, §Gotchas, §Relay contract) before starting any item.
Done-check for every item: tick the item's checkbox below, then `make test` must
be fully green (see CLAUDE.md §Testing for the expected-red semantics).

## Items

<!-- 2026-07-19 handoff C2 (run relay-handoff, this session): promoted the three ungated,
     handoff-ready af48/related [HARD — pool] children from TODO.md — single-id-two-views
     (D2): ac7f/78df reuse their TODO twins (children-of:af48), 66d4 reuses its TODO twin.
     RED specs authored this handoff (C3): tests/test_wire_grammar_classify.sh (ac7f),
     tests/test_review_gate_tier_coverage.sh (66d4), tests/test_consumer_enum.sh (78df).
     GATED siblings NOT promoted: bea2/2b49 (gated-on:ac7f), 0c86 (gated-on:077d),
     07dc (children-of:7a05 substrate). -->

- [x] [HARD — pool] **`@wire` grammar + `classify-repo` count + `drained` render-alias** (KEYSTONE — build first; af48 child C1) <!-- children-of:af48 --><!-- id:ac7f --> — **DONE 2026-07-19 (relay HARD child, id:da26)**: (1) grammar — `@wire` documented in `relay/references/hard-lanes.md` (new "## The `@wire` marker" section: orthogonal marker recorded by the executor-verifiable-via-a-host/e2e-RED-spec property, the D3 two-linked-items split, the D1 drained=render-alias note) + a marker pointer in `templates.md`; `executor-contract.md` deliberately UNTOUCHED (`@wire` adds no new executor obligation — an executor picks a `@wire` item like any RED-spec-backed ROADMAP item — so no version bump). (2) `classify-repo.sh` — an open `@wire` item on a primary executor lane (`[ROUTINE]`/`[HARD — pool]`/`[HARD]`), not `@manual`/human-gated/blocked/exempt, now counts toward `actionable_routine_open` → the classify-verdict execute gate fires (`verdict=execute`); `@manual` stays excluded. (3) `drained` render-alias — new `relay/scripts/render-verdict.sh` (idle→"drained", every other verdict verbatim; the ONLY sanctioned emitter of the word, NO new classify-verdict enum). `tests/test_wire_grammar_classify.sh` (`# roadmap:ac7f`) GREEN; full suite 263/0. — define `@wire` as a new **orthogonal marker** (like `@manual`/`@needs-auth`, NOT a lane), recorded by the *executor-verifiable-via-a-host/e2e-RED-spec* property (NOT narrowly "UI wiring"). Three deliverables, all pinned by `tests/test_wire_grammar_classify.sh`:
  1. **Grammar docs** — `relay/references/hard-lanes.md` (+ `templates.md`, `references/executor-contract.md`) document `@wire` by its property, orthogonal to lane tags, AND the **two-linked-items split** for a two-phase feature (a `@wire` executor item + a separate `@manual` human item `gated-on:` it; split ONLY where both phases are real — D3).
  2. **`classify-repo.sh` count (D4)** — an open item carrying `@wire` on a primary executor lane (`[ROUTINE]`/`[HARD — pool]`/`[HARD]`), NOT human-gated/`@manual`/blocked/exempt-section, **counts toward `actionable_routine_open`** (today only `[ROUTINE]` does — `:131`/`:142`). `@manual` stays excluded (unchanged, the safe under-dispatch direction). Downstream consumer: `classify-verdict.sh:131` execute gate → a `@wire` item yields `verdict=execute`.
  3. **`drained` render-alias (D1)** — NO new `classify-verdict.sh` enum. A mechanical render path emits the token `"drained"` **only** as a rendering of `verdict=idle` (which, once (2) lands, already implies zero open `@wire` half) — the word is quoted from the classifier, never authored freehand. Interface authored by this handoff: a new `relay/scripts/render-verdict.sh` reading a classify-verdict JSON on stdin → prints a display label, `idle`→`drained`, every other verdict verbatim. (Interface is the spec — see REVIEW_ME judgment note.)
  - **Acceptance / done-check**: tick this box, then `make test` green — `tests/test_wire_grammar_classify.sh` (`# roadmap:ac7f`) goes from EXPECTED-RED to PASS across all three deliverables. **Consumers enumerated** (per id:78df discipline): `actionable_routine_open` is read by `classify-verdict.sh` (execute gate, `:51`/`:131`), `classify-repo.sh` `--emit unit` field (`:294`), and relay-doctor check 10 / invariant I2 — the spec covers the classify-verdict execute-gate path (the routing-determining consumer); the `--emit unit` + relay-doctor passthroughs are field re-exports of the same integer and need no separate wire logic.
  - **Context**: `relay/scripts/classify-repo.sh` (:80-144), `relay/scripts/classify-verdict.sh` (:38-135), `relay/references/hard-lanes.md`; design `docs/meeting-notes/2026-07-19-1152-drained-verdict-wire-manual-grammar.md` (D1/D3/D4). TODO twin id:ac7f.

- [x] [HARD — pool] **Tier-coverage checkpoint gate** (mechanizes `review.md §3` / id:f032) <!-- id:66d4 --> — **DONE 2026-07-19 (relay HARD child, id:da26)**: shipped `relay/scripts/review-gate.sh` (`--repo <dir> --entry <file>`). Enumerates declared test tiers (package.json `scripts` keys containing "test" — the RED-spec source — plus Makefile `test`-named targets, deduped; tier-name = key/target verbatim so `test`≠`test:e2e`) and refuses the checkpoint (nonzero + offending tier on stderr) unless the entry covers each tier with a `<tier>: <result>` line OR a `SKIPPED-TIER: <tier> — <reason>` line. Toolchain-presence probe scoped to a marker UNDER `<dir>` (populated `<dir>/node_modules`) to stay HERMETIC — global caches (`~/.cache/ms-playwright`) are deliberately NOT consulted (a home-cache probe would make the acceptance test host-dependent); the result-token/skip matchers anchor on `<tier>: `/`SKIPPED-TIER: <tier> ` (colon-space / trailing space) so a `test:e2e:` line can't falsely satisfy the bare `test` tier. `tests/test_review_gate_tier_coverage.sh` (`# roadmap:66d4`) GREEN across all four cases (a missing-tier→refuse, b all-reported→accept, c skip+toolchain-present→refuse, d skip+toolchain-absent→accept); full suite 264/0. CI-config manifest source noted as a future extension point in the script header (no tier source needs it yet). — a review-checkpoint script (`relay/scripts/review-gate.sh`) that enumerates the repo's **declared** test tiers from its own manifests (`Makefile` targets, `package.json` scripts, CI config) and **refuses the checkpoint** (nonzero exit) unless the checkpoint entry carries, per declared tier, either a **result token** (`<tier>: <N> passed` / `<tier>: <result>`) or a **`SKIPPED-TIER: <tier> — <reason>`** line. Crucially the gate **probes toolchain presence to validate a skip**: a `SKIPPED-TIER` claim is REJECTED (nonzero) if the toolchain is in fact present (e.g. `node_modules`/`~/.cache/ms-playwright` populated for an e2e tier) — a judgment excuse ("doc-only window") must NOT satisfy it. Because it is a script, subagents running it are bound automatically (a filed chidiai case does not propagate to subagents; only a gate does).
  - **Interface authored by this handoff** (the spec): `review-gate.sh --repo <dir> --entry <file>` — reads declared tiers from `<dir>`'s manifests, checks `<file>` (the checkpoint entry text) covers each; exit 0 = all tiers accounted, nonzero + the offending tier on stderr = refuse. Toolchain-presence probe is per-tier (a tier maps to a presence marker under `<dir>`).
  - **Acceptance / done-check**: tick this box, then `make test` green — `tests/test_review_gate_tier_coverage.sh` (`# roadmap:66d4`) PASS: (a) missing-tier entry → refuse; (b) all-tiers-reported entry → accept; (c) `SKIPPED-TIER` with toolchain PRESENT → refuse; (d) `SKIPPED-TIER` with toolchain ABSENT → accept.
  - **Context**: `relay/references/review.md §3`, `relay/scripts/ckpt-tag.sh` (candidate co-host), id:f032 (the fully-specified-but-LLM-trusted rule). TODO twin id:66d4.

- [ ] [HARD — pool] **Spec-completeness handoff consumer-enumeration aid** (af48 child C4) <!-- children-of:af48 --><!-- id:78df --> — a handoff-time listing aid `relay/scripts/consumer-enum.sh <artifact> [root]` that lists every file referencing/reading `<artifact>` (the readers of the artifact a RED spec governs), so a handoff author cannot silently miss a consumer. **A listing aid, not a gate** — it surfaces readers (exit 0, one path per line), it does NOT mechanically prove coverage. Pairs with the discipline (documented in `references/handoff.md`) that a RED spec **names the consumers it covers**.
  - **Acceptance / done-check**: tick this box, then `make test` green — `tests/test_consumer_enum.sh` (`# roadmap:78df`) PASS: given a fixture tree where an artifact is read by N files, the aid lists all N (and excludes the artifact's own definition file / non-readers); a nonexistent artifact lists nothing and still exits 0 (aid, not gate).
  - **Context**: `references/handoff.md` (C3 spec discipline), chidiai `red-spec-verified-named-consumers`. TODO twin id:78df.

- [ ] [INPUT — meeting] **Execute+review for the SAME repo in one run collides on the non-union ROADMAP.md** — ARCHITECTURE COMMITMENT, owner decision required; do NOT implement from this entry. Problem + candidates + a recommendation are drafted; take them to `/meeting`. Evidence: run `relay-20260717-100452-13146` (loderite) — the review→execute re-chain (`relay-loop.js:~1966`) fires when the review CHILD RETURNS, before `integrate()` merges the review's worktree, so the execute child branched from a pre-promotion `main`, ticked 4c02, and conflicted with the merged review. `ROADMAP.md` is explicitly NOT `merge=union` (checkbox toggles cannot union — SKILL.md Guardrails), so an execute+review pair on one repo is a near-guaranteed ledger collision. **RECOMMENDATION (not a decision — requires owner ratification at `/meeting`): C1 now** (move the re-chain's `queue.push` from the child-settle path into `integrate()`'s merged branch, gated on `result.openRoutine > 0`, with a loud dispatch assertion) **with C2 as fallback** (hard invariant: never dispatch two units for the same repo in one round — defers the re-chained execute to round N+1's fresh discovery) **if C1's "re-chained unit silently never dispatched" risk proves real; C3 (split the ledger) explicitly NOT here — route into id:2840.** Weaknesses stated plainly: this is a one-instance fix (C2 is the class-fix, recommended against on cost grounds only, not correctness — if the owner weights class-safety over round latency, C2 is the better choice); C1's own failure mode is the same family as id:1735; n=1 (rate unknown, "log it and wait" per id:194e's `merge-conflict` category is a legitimate fourth option not developed here); `queue.push` pickup from inside the integrator chain in all lane orderings is UNVERIFIED. Relates id:1735, id:689c. <!-- gated-on:owner-ratification --> <!-- id:dc5b -->

- [ ] [INPUT — decision] **relay-loop: handback sites diverge from the handback event log in BOTH directions** — audit surfaced while specing id:1735. RE-LANED 2026-07-17 (review) from `[ROUTINE]`: the item's core is a design-judgment call ("Decide whether the event log is meant to be complete… confirm the intended taxonomy rather than assume it") — the emit-at-five-sites work is downstream of and gated on that decision, so it is NOT clean executor-actionable routine. Once the owner rules on completeness + whether the INTENSIVE-fail-closed 1915 site (`worktreePath:'-'`) belongs in the handback taxonomy, the emit follow-up becomes routine. Lines 1807 and 1999 push to `state.blocked` AND `pushEvent('handback', …)`; lines 1657, 1668 and 1915 push to `state.blocked` WITHOUT emitting an event. So the event log is a strict SUBSET of the real handbacks, and `~/.config/relay/relay-events.jsonl` under-reports (a child terminal failure and a contract_met=false handback both leave no event). id:1735's invariant is therefore only assertable as `handbacks[] ⊇ handback-events`. Decide whether the event log is meant to be complete; if yes, emit at all five sites and tighten id:1735's assertion to equality. Note 1915 (INTENSIVE fail-closed) carries `worktreePath: '-'` so it is not a handback in the summary's sense — the audit should confirm the intended taxonomy rather than assume it. Optional — low priority; not gating id:1735 or id:4ca8. <!-- id:4a46 -->

- [ ] [INPUT — decision] echo-runner agentType for relay-loop mechanical agents — measure, then adopt or reject (id:f599) — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:human): Needs a live instrumented probe run (per-hop subagent token cost with vs without agentType:'echo-runner' over a representative round); the mechanical agent() hops execute only in the Workflow-sandbox runtime, unreachable from a worktree, and the item bars a reasoned decision without measured data. Re-lane back to the pool lane once the measurement exists. — needs /relay human <!-- id:f599 --> — **DECIDED 2026-07-13 (relay human): BUILD THE PROBE.** Owner authorized building the instrumented in-sandbox probe run (per-hop subagent token cost with vs without `agentType:'echo-runner'` over a representative round), then decide adopt/reject on the measured delta. Next step: author the probe harness (runs only in the Workflow-sandbox runtime); keep this box open until the measurement exists.
  - **Why** (TODO id:f599): `~/.claude/agents/echo-runner.md` (haiku + Bash-only + 3-line system prompt) was verified working via Workflow `agentType` on 2026-07-02 (a probe returned verbatim stdout; the registry picks up new defs mid-session with lag). Candidate adoption: the relay-loop.js prelude + the mechanical-runner `agent()` calls gain `agentType: 'echo-runner'` so a purely-mechanical "run this command and echo stdout" hop can't be mangled by a general-purpose agent.
  - **Design / GATE (measure-then-decide, why this is [HARD] not [ROUTINE])**: GATE on a MEASURED relay-econ before/after — one probe run cost ~20.6k subagent tokens, so the harness floor may dominate and swamp any real saving. This is not a mechanical apply: the strong session must (a) measure the per-hop token cost of the current mechanical `agent()` calls vs the same calls with `agentType: 'echo-runner'` over a representative round, and (b) decide by the pre-registered criterion: **adopt only if the delta is real** (a measured, non-noise reduction). If ADOPTED: move `~/.claude/agents/echo-runner.md` INTO this repo (under a tracked path) + add a `make install`/`make install-<x>` symlink for it, and wire `agentType: 'echo-runner'` into the mechanical-runner `agent()` calls in `relay/scripts/relay-loop.js`. If REJECTED: record the measurement + the reason in RELAY_LOG.md and delete the loose `~/.claude/agents/echo-runner.md`. Either way the loose out-of-repo def must not persist unexamined.
  - **Acceptance**: a decision recorded in RELAY_LOG.md with the before/after measurement; on adopt — the agent def is in-repo + installable + wired, `lint-workflow-templates.mjs` clean, `make test` green; on reject — the loose def deleted and the rationale logged. No red test (the deliverable is a measured decision + its follow-through, not a fixed behavior).
  - **Context**: `~/.claude/agents/echo-runner.md` (the loose def), `relay/scripts/relay-loop.js` (prelude + mechanical-runner `agent()` calls), the id:d267 quota-sample / subagent-token accounting for the econ measurement, TODO id:f599.

<!-- 2026-07-08 handoff C2 (run relay-20260708-162516-22523): promoted the sole `promote`-
     disposition TODO item (unpromoted-scan: 1 promote / 58 surface / 1 laned). Single-id-two-
     views (D2): id:356f reuses its open TODO.md twin (routed:dfc1 from llm-from-scratch). -->

- [ ] [HARD — decision gate] Relay consumer of the id:2840 derived ledger index (cross-ledger / count / promotion) — ✅ DECISION RESOLVED + BUILD AUTHORIZED 2026-07-14 (relay human): id:2840 producer shipped (project_manager id:bac5 CORE + id:608c `proj graph`, edges.json contract locked) → build the relay-side consumer. Artifact confirmed live 2026-07-14 (`proj refresh` → 1288 nodes / 2791 edges, `proj graph` consumes it); wire relay review/human + the count line to read it via the stable contract (retire `orphan-scan --cross-ledger` + the d5e0 count prose, id:1de1). <!-- id:659c --> — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:decision-gate): Premise false: shipped edges.json is a co-citation graph (no checkbox-state/count) — cannot retire orphan-scan --cross-ledger; decide project_manager index-extension vs. keep-guard + drop-count-only (id:1de1). — needs a /meeting
  - ✅ GATE RESOLVED 2026-07-14 (relay human): the project_manager derived index (id:2840, `routed:1e99`) shipped its producer + locked artifact contract (id:bac5 CORE + id:608c `proj graph`), so this re-lanes `[INPUT — decision]`→`[HARD — pool]` and is now pool-dispatchable. Build: relay `review`/`human` + the TODO count line read the artifact instead of hand-grepping; retire the per-review TODO-twin close + the `orphan-scan --cross-ledger` hand-check; DROP the d5e0 count prose (folds in TODO id:1de1). Artifact confirmed live 2026-07-14: `proj refresh` emits a real populated `~/.cache/project_manager/edges.json` (1288 nodes / 2791 edges over 39 repos) and `proj graph [--public]` consumes it — build against the live artifact. Meeting: `docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-23-0803-ledger-drift-derived-index.md`.

- [x] [HARD] Explicit `[HARD]` lane tags + bucket the human-backlog HARD surface (done 2026-06-22, relay HARD child — relay/bash half) <!-- id:78ff -->
  - **Done 2026-06-22** (relay HARD child, id:da26): shipped the relay/bash half. (1) Lane vocabulary doc `relay/references/hard-lanes.md` — the single shared contract both `gather-human-backlog.sh` (id:78ff) and project_manager `scan.py` (id:b466) read: `[HARD — pool|meeting|hands]` lanes + `[HARD — decision gate]`/`🚧 route:meeting|human|decision-gate` as meeting-lane aliases (id:3801); `[INTENSIVE]` is the orthogonal resource axis, not a lane. (2) `gather-human-backlog.sh`: replaced `emit_gated_hard` (single `gated_hard` lump) with `emit_hard_lanes` — READS the explicit lane tag → emits per-lane kind `hard_pool`/`hard_meeting`/`hard_hands`; an open `[HARD]` with NO recognized lane prints a stderr `ERROR:` and forces a NONZERO exit (id:415b grammar-tightening-with-loud-rejection, never silently default). (3) `references/human.md` §2/§3/return-summary: the three buckets are now distinct call-to-actions (pool→FYI/`--afk`, meeting→`/meeting`, hands→"you run these"), not one /meeting firehose. (4) Back-filled THIS repo's bare `[HARD — strong model]` items: de4e→meeting, 401c→pool, 3346→meeting; dba3 left as its machine-managed `[HARD — decision gate]` alias. Acceptance test `tests/test_hard_lane_buckets.sh` (roadmap:78ff) green. **Residual (not this worktree's scope):** cross-repo back-fill of OTHER confirmed-own repos' bare `[HARD — strong model]` tags — a relay child works ONE repo's worktree; the per-repo lane back-fill belongs to each repo's next handoff/review or a `/relay human` sweep (the collector now LOUD-rejects any un-back-filled untagged HARD, so the gap is self-surfacing). project_manager id:b466 (Python half) consumes this same `hard-lanes.md` contract.
  - **Design + rationale: TODO id:78ff** (single-id-two-views — the "why" lives there). DECISION 2026-06-21 (user "obviously explicit"): every open `[HARD]` ROADMAP item declares a lane in its bracket tag — `[HARD — pool]` (this `--afk` pool runs it via the `hard` verdict, id:da26), `[HARD — meeting]` (≡ `[HARD — decision gate]`/`🚧 route:…`, id:3801 → `/meeting`), `[HARD — hands]` (hardware/sudo/secret/on-device/rehearsal → "you run these"). `[INTENSIVE — <resource>]` (id:8d52) is an ORTHOGONAL resource axis, not a lane.
  - **Scope (this is the relay/bash half; `proj relay` half = project_manager id:b466):**
    1. Document the lane vocabulary ONCE in `relay/references/` (the single source both tools read).
    2. `gather-human-backlog.sh`: replace the "emit every `[HARD]` as gated_hard" lump with reading the explicit lane tag → emit a `bucket` field (pool|meeting|hands); a `[HARD]` with NO lane tag is emitted as `untagged` and the script EXITS NONZERO / prints a LOUD warning (id:415b grammar-tightening-with-loud-rejection — never silently default).
    3. `references/human.md`: present the three buckets as distinct call-to-actions (pool→"run /relay --afk", meeting→/meeting, hands→checklist), not one "/meeting" firehose.
    4. Back-fill every existing bare `[HARD — strong model]` across all confirmed `own` repos to an explicit lane (use the 2026-06-21 manual re-bucketing in the diary as the starting classification).
  - **Acceptance:** a new `tests/test_hard_lane_buckets.sh` (`# roadmap:78ff`): a ROADMAP fixture with one item per lane + one untagged asserts gather-human-backlog emits the right `bucket` per item AND exits nonzero (loud) on the untagged one; the lane vocabulary doc exists; cross-check that the marker set matches project_manager's (id:b466). RED until implemented.
  - **Coupling:** ships its vocabulary doc BEFORE or WITH project_manager id:b466 (shared contract; keep them in sync). Relates id:3801/da26/8d52/9c92/415b.

- [ ] [HARD — decision gate] Cold fixed-prompt probe: re-pose Opus-degradation incidents #2 (confident-wrong "zkm-* on another machine") and #3 (over-engineered ~/.claude branch-split) against fresh Opus; record pass/fail vs the recorded incident behaviour, finding written into `docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-17-0836-opus-degradation-investigation.md`. Promoted 2026-07-13 (user) from TODO id:e3c0 (single-id-two-views — same id spans both ledgers). **Why HARD**: requires apex judgment to assess whether fresh Opus reproduces the confident-wrong / over-engineering behaviour. Bounded: two fixed prompts, pass/fail each, one meeting-note write. <!-- id:e3c0 --> — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:human): Cold probe needs memory/CLAUDE.md-free Opus (id:2d01 relay-probe user); creds not yet copied (id:dba3 HANDS residue) + sudo forbidden; same-user run is contaminated. — needs /relay human
- [ ] [HARD] Strong-model audit: code review, security, and design coherence <!-- id:401c --> <!-- relay:recurring-audit -->
  - **Why HARD**: requires adversarial judgment — finding subtle bugs, security issues,
    and internal contradictions in design docs that a weaker model would miss or dismiss.
    Also requires holding the full design history in mind to spot feasibility gaps.
  - **Acceptance**: a meeting note documenting findings across three passes:
    (1) **Code review** — correctness bugs, error handling gaps, shell quoting issues,
    race conditions, unhandled edge cases in scripts and Python helpers;
    (2) **Security audit** — injection risks (command, path, jq), unvalidated inputs
    at system boundaries, secrets exposure, file permission assumptions;
    (3) **Design coherence** — check currently-unreviewed design decisions (anything
    added since last Fable turn) for sensibility, feasibility, and internal
    contradictions (e.g. a TODO gate that can never fire, a contract rule that
    contradicts another). Each finding is either fixed inline (if trivial), or
    becomes a new TODO/ROADMAP item with the finding quoted as context. No finding
    is silently dropped — if assessed as acceptable risk, say so explicitly.
  - **Tests**: none (audit output is the deliverable; follow-on items get their own tests)
  - **Done-check**: meeting note at `docs/meeting-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-strong-model-audit.md`
    exists; every finding is either fixed, tracked, or explicitly accepted with rationale.
  - **Context**: run after each significant batch of Sonnet executor work or design changes.
    First run: covers all work since `fable-ckpt-20260612-1328`. Subsequent runs: diff
    against the most recent `fable-ckpt-*` tag (same window as review mode step 2).
  - **Run log** (recurring item — stays open by design):
    - Run 1 (2026-06-12-1811): `fable-ckpt-20260612-1328`..HEAD — see meeting note.
    - Run 2 (2026-06-15-1520): `fable-ckpt-20260612-1827`..HEAD (relay scripts surface) — F1/F2 → id:c8db.
    - Run 3 (2026-06-15-1745): `relay-ckpt-20260615-1559`..HEAD — **2 defects fixed inline**:
      `test_relay_executor.sh` asserted a stub commit 608800b removed (suite was 1-red on
      arrival, now 48/0); id:3826 gaming-flag logger was a dead feed (review dispatch prompt
      never requested its fields) — fixed + regression-guard added. See
      `docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-15-1745-strong-model-audit.md`.
    - Run 4 (2026-06-15-1759): `relay-ckpt-20260615-1748`..HEAD (1 commit: `bf70a52`
      statusline/check-deps.sh) — **clean**: no code/security defects. One **coherence drift
      fixed inline** — id:414a was still marked `GATED` on id:fa05+id:dfaf, both now shipped;
      updated the gate line to CLEARED so a future strong session isn't misled into skipping it.
      See `docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-15-1759-strong-model-audit.md`.
    - Run 5 (2026-06-15-1937): `relay-ckpt-20260615-1748`..HEAD (~270 lines / 10 files; code:
      relay-loop.js ×2 + 2 tests) — **clean**: no code/security defects, no inline fix needed.
      Verified the two pool-crash fixes (failed-shard surfacing via order-preserving `chunks[i]`;
      removal of `new Date()`/`process.env` forbidden in the Workflow sandbox) correct with genuine
      regression guards, and the cross-ledger state coherent (0 open ROUTINE / 3 open HARD; d5e0
      summary agrees). See `docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-15-1937-strong-model-audit.md`.
    - Run 6 (2026-06-15-1937b): `relay-ckpt-20260615-1937..HEAD` (only first-seen code:
      the 2-line `paused` filter in gather-human-backlog.sh, 7456e1f) — **clean**: no
      code/security/coherence defects. One forward-robustness gap **fixed inline** — the
      new `paused = true` sweep-skip filter shipped without a test; added a non-vacuous

      the `warn_nested_worktrees` stale-checkout guard in gather-human-backlog.sh,
      83d8614) — **clean**: no code/security/coherence defects (`set -e`-safe grep
      guards, `-F` fixed-string prefix match with trailing-slash, stdout/stderr split all
      correct). One forward-robustness gap **fixed inline** (same class as Run 6) — the
      new warning shipped without a test; added a non-vacuous regression guard (section 4:
      real-git nested-worktree fixture + clean-repo negative control + stdout-clean

      `grep -- "$ARG"` option-safe, no injection/traversal/secrets). One coherence drift
      **fixed inline** — both scripts' header comments documented a one-wildcard search root
      (`projects/*/subagents/workflows`) while the code+real layout use two
      (`projects/*/*/...`); updated the comments to match. One cosmetic dead-code residue in

      **fixed inline** — `relay-state-write.sh` event-append header claimed "SAME flock" but
      correctly flocks the target events file (not the shared $LOCK); corrected the comment +
      Paths note + `--help` range. Three findings **accepted** w/ rationale: relay-burn.sh
      `date -d "$reset"` awk-shellout injection seam (LOW — `resets_at` is provider-controlled

      `model-probe.sh` (241L), `settings-env.py` (90L), `model-probe.battery.jsonl`. **Clean —
      no inline fixes** (code clean to a high bar): discovery cache correctly hashes a superset
      of the 9 shard inputs, fail-open sound throughout; settings-env.py idempotent/non-clobbering;
      battery JSONL valid, no secrets. **2 LOW findings tracked**: id:4348 (discover-sig.sh
      `upstream` read without fetch → bounded origin-behind under-invalidation — needs a measured
      fetch-vs-accept decision) + id:b9b5 (model-probe.sh grade `echo`→`printf` robustness). 3
      findings explicitly accepted (awk -v repo-name = id:c8db-class zero-risk; review-range

    - Run 14 (2026-06-17, via /relay human Pareto pick): `relay-ckpt-20260617-1326..HEAD` — first-seen
      code = the id:bbd2 `migrate-state-dirs.sh` rewrite (166L) + `test_migrate_state_dirs.sh` (new).
      Ran as a 3-pass adversarial audit (correctness / security / design-coherence) of THIS session's
      own work. **4 real defects fixed inline** (audit caught them in freshly-written code): (1) HIGH —
      jsonl merge `cat src dest | awk` fused two records into one corrupt line when src lacked a trailing
      newline (silent log loss); fixed with `awk 1 … | awk 'NF && !seen'` + a no-trailing-newline test.
      Verified the LIVE `relay-events.jsonl` was NOT corrupted (the appender always terminates lines → 0
      fused / 358 valid). (2) MED — dir-union swallowed a partial `cp` failure then `rm -rf`'d src → lost
      un-copied children; now drops src only on cp success, else refuses. (3) MED — idle guard failed OPEN
      on `claim.sh`/`stat` errors and peeked one base; now fails CLOSED and peeks both old+new. (4) MED —
      `ASSUME_IDLE` bypass now warns loudly on stderr. Test grew 9→12 cases (added no-trailing-newline,
      NEW-newer snapshot, type-mismatch refusal). Design/spec claims all independently re-verified TRUE
      (symlinks, 358 events, 48 gather). 1 LOW tracked: id:16e9 (pre-existing flaky `test_relay_claim_liveness.sh`,
      roadmap:7570 — unrelated to this change). Suite 66/66.

      0d31 relay-status-publish, c855 push-seed cache, 3801 handback-followup.py, b841 nested
      quotaThresholds fold, 2425 crossedBucket). **Clean** — no inline code/security fix needed.
      Verified: gather-repo-state.sh builds JSON via env vars (no injection), discover-sig.sh ⟷
      gather-repo-state.sh hash the SAME superset (no stale-verdict hazard for the c3a6/c855
      caches), push-seed seeds `idle` only at provably-drained 0/0 (no under-dispatch), handback
      follow-up POSIX-escapes every shell arg + fire-and-forget, git-lock-push/clean-tree-gate
      both refuse to force-clean a foreign-dirty tree, profile-run.sh rollup-needle removed.
      shard-canary corpus is the correct behavior-preservation net for the 11ad refactor.

      TEXT, not its behaviour. Fixed: declared the schema property, added an explicit "COPY
      is_finished verbatim" prompt line, and added two non-vacuous assertions to

      branch 2 patched an idle unit's `.intensive` but never flipped `verdict` off `'idle'`,

## Capability-keyed lane taxonomy — slice A (meeting 2026-07-02-1924)

Slice A of the capability-keyed lane taxonomy + mechanical-run daemon
(`docs/meeting-notes/2026-07-02-1924-relay-mechanical-lane-capability-taxonomy.md`).
**Additive only** — introduces the `[MECHANICAL]` capability tier, its recipe/permit/probe
substrate, and the check-and-defer resource arbitration, WITHOUT renaming any existing lane
(the `[HARD — *]`→new-vocab rename is slice B, GATED below). Single-id-two-views (D2): every
id reuses its open TODO.md twin under the `[UMBRELLA]`.

## Capability-keyed lane taxonomy — wave 2a (MECHANICAL end-to-end)

Wave 2a makes the `[MECHANICAL]` tag END-TO-END: slice A shipped the CONSUMER half only
(the classifier RECOGNIZES `[MECHANICAL]`→the pool-inert `mechanical` verdict), but no
relay layer PRODUCES the tag and nothing RUNS it. Source of truth: the
`## Amendment 2026-07-02 (post-build — the `[MECHANICAL]` producer gap)` section of
`docs/meeting-notes/2026-07-02-1924-relay-mechanical-lane-capability-taxonomy.md`. These
three items (single-id-two-views D2 — each reuses its open TODO.md twin) are UN-GATED —
their deps (A1 id:7616, A2 id:64d3, A4 id:e407, A5 id:68dc) are all landed `[x]`. Uses the
CURRENT lane vocabulary (`[ROUTINE]`/`[HARD — pool]`) — the two-axis rename is wave 2b
(B1/B2, GATED below), NOT here.

## Capability-keyed lane taxonomy — wave 2b (lane-vocabulary RENAME)

Wave 2b executes the `[HARD — <suffix>]` → two-axis-vocabulary RENAME ratified in the meeting
(`docs/meeting-notes/2026-07-02-1924-relay-mechanical-lane-capability-taxonomy.md`, decisions
1+2). **This is the meeting's flagged BLAST-RADIUS step** — the lane vocabulary was hardened
four days ago across ~30 lane-asserting tests + the crash-prone `relay-loop.js` engine, so the
rename is deliberately staged **additive-then-flip** with a deterministic converter and a
DUAL-VOCABULARY lint window (both old and new accepted ERROR-free for one window). NEVER a
flag-day (Riku). Dep A1 (id:7616, `[MECHANICAL]` tag) is landed `[x]`, so B1 is now UN-GATED
and dispatchable; B2 stays gated on B1 (below). Single-id-two-views (D2): both ids reuse their
open TODO.md twin.

**Target taxonomy (decision 1).** Two orthogonal axes — **capability**: `[ROUTINE]` (executor
LLM) · `[HARD]` (strong LLM) · `[INPUT — {meeting,decision,access}]` (human ± LLM; sub-type =
effort) · `[MECHANICAL]` (compute only) — × **resource** (orthogonal): `[INTENSIVE — <res>]`.
The MAPPING: the THREE UNAMBIGUOUS 1:1 renames the converter AUTO-APPLIES — `[HARD — pool]`→`[HARD]`,
`[HARD — meeting]`→`[INPUT — meeting]`, `[HARD — decision gate]`→`[INPUT — decision]`. `[HARD — hands]`
is DELIBERATELY NOT auto-converted: "hardware/sudo/secret/on-device/rehearsal" fragments across FOUR
destinations — `[MECHANICAL]` (a daemon can run it) · `[INPUT — access]` (human provides a
credential/key/physical access) · `[INPUT — decision]` (human must ratify, e.g. it-infra fd30
post-gate decisions) · `[INPUT — meeting]` (human+LLM design judgment, e.g. a rehearsal whose
outcome needs interpretation) — so the converter FLAGS every `[HARD — hands]` item for per-item
human judgment (those four candidates) and converts it to NONE of them (no default). Aligns with M3
(id:3ef7) + the conformance-sweep detector-surfaces/human-decides rule. `[ROUTINE]` / `[MECHANICAL]`
/ `[INTENSIVE — <res>]` are UNCHANGED. **SCOPE (owner-locked):** this wave
migrates THIS repo's contract + lane-readers + tests + THIS repo's own ROADMAP/TODO item tags
only. Cross-repo item re-tagging in OTHER repos is a SEPARATE gated migration — the dual-vocab
window is exactly what lets those migrate later.

### GATED — B2 migration (DEP: 4f02, NOT dispatchable until B1 lands)

Parked under a GATED heading (roadmap-lint-exempt, non-dispatchable) until B1 (id:4f02) ships
the converter + dual-vocab window. This is a LARGE migration — its acceptance DECOMPOSES into
three separable sub-checks (B2a readers+references / B2b relay-loop.js / B2c this-repo
ledgers+tests) that MAY be dispatched as separate executors (see the handoff report's split
recommendation). Do NOT dispatch until 4f02 is ticked.

- [ ] [INPUT — decision] B2c-finalizer — CLOSE the dual-vocab window: convert this-repo ledgers + migrate ~30 lane tests + flip old-vocab→lint ERROR 🚧 GATED (DEP: 3ef7 + cross-repo re-tag) — **human 2026-07-11 (relay human): keep OPEN, gate re-confirmed.** Blocker is the cross-repo re-tag, NOT tooling (lane-convert id:4b37 shipped): 27 own repos + project_manager scan.py still emit old vocab (71 live `[HARD — pool|meeting|hands|decision gate]` tags), so flipping old→ERROR now would break them. This is `[INPUT — decision]` = a deliberate coordinated migration the human triggers (each repo's next `/relay handoff` runs `lane-convert`, then this closes), never autonomous pool work. <!-- id:7df1 -->
  - **Why**: B2 (id:8111) landed reader+reference+engine DUAL-ACCEPT — old and new vocab both
    ERROR-free. The window must stay OPEN until every OTHER surface is on the new vocab, then close
    in one deliberate flip. This is the tail the meeting deliberately deferred.
  - **Acceptance**:
    1. `lane-convert.sh --in-place` on THIS repo's `ROADMAP.md` + `TODO.md` (own tags only; the
       converter auto-renames pool/meeting/decision-gate and FLAGS each `[HARD — hands]` — resolve
       those per-item into one of the four candidates by M3/human judgment, never a blanket default).
    2. Migrate the ~30 lane-asserting `tests/test_*.sh` + `test_hard_lane_buckets.sh` marker-set
       cross-check to the new vocab.
    3. FINAL step — CLOSE the window: `roadmap-lint.sh` + `gather-human-backlog.sh` make an OLD-vocab
       lane a hard ERROR (drop the dual-accept branches; delete the "window OPEN" prose in
       hard-lanes.md/human.md/review.md/handoff.md/conventions.md).
  - **Done-check**: `make test` fully green with every lane-asserting test on the new vocab AND an
    old-vocab `[HARD — pool]` fixture now LINT-REJECTED (a new red-then-green window-closed test).
  - **Blocked on**: 3ef7 (M3 per-item `[HARD — hands]` re-lane must resolve this repo's hands items
    first) AND the cross-repo re-tag (other own repos + `project_manager`'s `scan.py`, id:b466, must
    speak new vocab — the window can't close while any consumer is old-vocab-only). Closing early
    would break every repo still on `[HARD — *]`.
  - **d259 RATIFIED 2026-07-06 (meeting `docs/meeting-notes/2026-07-06-0959-machine-tag-format-endgame.md`):** endgame = (C) tag-first bracketed position (B rejected). The reorder tool (`lane-convert --reorder` isolated mode) + tag-first WARN lint are built AHEAD, ungated, as **id:4b37** — NOT authored inside this item. So this item's acceptance step 1 becomes: run the ALREADY-BUILT `lane-convert --in-place --reorder` (renames + reorders in one pass), and step 3's FINAL flip also flips 4b37's tag-first lint WARN→ERROR alongside old-vocab→ERROR (one window-close). Delete the 7 anchoring reimplementations in the step-2 reader migration.

Decomposition of the orphan-reconcile design. **Sequence: D1 → D2/D3** (D2's reconcile
mode and D3's binding both operate on the `relay/orphan/*` namespace D1 creates). D4

## Model probe (id:dba3 deliverable)

Sub-items of the `[HARD — strong model]` umbrella id:dba3. Design fully settled in
`docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-17-0836-opus-degradation-investigation.md` (D2/D5/D6) and
`docs/meeting-notes/2026-06-17-0905-model-probe-tos-and-band.md` (D1/D2). Promoted to
ROADMAP 2026-06-17 so executors can work them; id:dba3 and id:23e9 (seed) stay `[HARD]`.

## Install-drift detection (meeting-adjacent, 2026-07-17, id:1102)

<!-- 2026-07-17. Filed by the apex session after VERIFYING and REPAIRING the live incident
     (make install-relay; roadmap-lint.sh now exits 0). Two of the apex's own hypotheses were
     FALSIFIED before this item was written — both recorded in TODO id:1102 rather than
     deleted, because the wrong ones explain why the existing guards missed it. -->

- [x] [ROUTINE] **memory-index.py silently mis-resolves `title:`/`hook:` when a writer re-nests them under `metadata:`** — OBSERVED TWICE 2026-07-17 (not speculative). Two memory files authored with top-level `title:`/`hook:` had both keys relocated **under `metadata:`** by a later write, so `build_entries` (`tools/memory-index.py` ~L237-241: `fm.get("title")`, `fm.get("hook")`) found neither at top level and **silently fell back** to `description:` (hook) and the filename stem (title) — a verbose, wrong index line with no error. <!-- id:e875 -->
  - **Step 1 — establish the culprit before fixing (do NOT guess; per the item's own directive):** reproduce by writing a memory file with top-level `title:`/`hook:`, then run each candidate writer and observe which relocates them under `metadata:` — candidates: the `Write`/`Edit` path, a frontmatter normalizer, the `claude-sessions-backup` commit, or `memory-index.py --write` round-tripping. Record the finding in the item/RELAY_LOG.
  - **Step 2 — fix (robust regardless of culprit, since some candidates are uncontrollable):** make `memory-index.py` resolve `title:`/`hook:` from BOTH top-level AND `metadata.*` (tolerate the nesting), AND make the fallback LOUD — emit a stderr warning when a file has `metadata.hook` but no top-level `hook:` (almost certainly this bug), never a silent `description:` substitution ([[no-swallow-stderr]] doctrine). If Step 1 finds a controllable writer, ALSO fix it to preserve key position.
  - **Acceptance**: `tests/test_memory_index_metadata_nesting.sh` (`# roadmap:e875`) green — RED spec written by the handoff. It asserts (a) a file whose `title:`/`hook:` live under `metadata:` resolves to those values (not stem/description), and (b) the resolver warns loudly to stderr on the metadata-only-hook case.
  - **Done-check**: tick this box, then `tests/run-tests.sh` fully green.
  - **Context**: `tools/memory-index.py` (`build_entries` resolution ~L234-253; `parse_frontmatter_text` already stores nested keys as `metadata.<key>` ~L152-162). Relates id:2e6d (the generated-index dissolution this depends on), [[memory-index-derived-2e6d]].

- [x] [ROUTINE] **`model-probe.sh grade` uses `echo "$output"` — bash builtin `echo` eats leading `-n`/`-e`/`-E` and mangles backslashes** — audit id:401c Run 11. `tools/model-probe.sh:38` is `echo "$output" | grep -qP "$regex"`; an output beginning with `-n`/`-e`/`-E` or containing backslashes is misinterpreted by the `echo` builtin, so grading can mismatch. Zero impact on today's numeric/word goldens, forward-robustness only. LOW severity, one-line fix. <!-- id:b9b5 -->
  - **Fix**: replace `echo "$output"` with `printf '%s\n' "$output"` at line 38.
  - **Acceptance**: `tests/test_model_probe.sh` extended with a `# roadmap:b9b5` case (RED spec written by the handoff): `grade` of an output that begins with a literal `-n ` (and one containing a backslash) against a regex that matches that literal text must exit 0. Currently RED (the `-n` is consumed by `echo`); GREEN after the `printf` change.
  - **Done-check**: tick this box, then `tests/run-tests.sh` fully green.
  - **Context**: `tools/model-probe.sh` grade arm (L34-40). Battery goldens unaffected.

- [x] [ROUTINE] **`tests/test_resource_claim_pid.sh` is FLAKY in the full suite** — passes 3/3 in isolation, fails ~50% of full-suite runs with "a stale-mtime claim with a LIVE live_pid was stolen — PID-liveness not honored": `claim.sh::pid_alive` intermittently false-negatives on a live `--pid` claim. Suspect root cause: `pid_alive` reads `.live_pid` via `jq … 2>/dev/null` and treats ANY transient read failure as empty→dead (the swallow, [[feedback-mechanize-no-swallow-stderr]]); under full-suite load a slow/interrupted `jq` or a background-`sleep`/PID-reuse race in the harness anchor makes the liveness check miss. Corrosive because every item's done-check runs `make test`. FIXED 2026-07-18 (executor): `pid_alive` now retries the `jq` read up to 3× (50ms backoff) before concluding dead — a transient fork/read failure clears on retry, while a genuine empty `.live_pid` still returns "" every time (legacy no-`--pid` path unaffected, test §3 still green). 20/20 parallel stress runs + full `make test` (262/0) green. <!-- id:ab5c -->
  - **Fix (do both):** (a) in `relay/scripts/claim.sh` `pid_alive`, distinguish "`jq` failed to read the file" from "`live_pid` field absent" — do NOT collapse a read error into a false "dead" (capture jq's exit status; only treat a successfully-parsed empty/non-numeric value as dead). (b) harden `tests/test_resource_claim_pid.sh`: assert `kill -0 $LIVE_PID` succeeds immediately before the liveness assertion (retry/poll rather than one-shot), and confirm no other test's cleanup can signal `$LIVE_PID`.
  - **Done-check**: tick this box, then run `tests/run-tests.sh` **five consecutive times, all fully green** (the flake reproduces ~50% of full-suite runs, so a single green run does NOT prove the fix — the 5× loop is the acceptance). No fresh RED spec: `test_resource_claim_pid.sh` itself IS the (intermittently) failing spec; the fix makes it deterministically green.
  - **Context**: `relay/scripts/claim.sh` (`pid_alive` ~L107, `.live_pid` read), `tests/test_resource_claim_pid.sh` (the `( trap - EXIT; exec sleep 600 ) & LIVE_PID=$!` anchor). Pre-existing since id:1b11.

- [x] [HARD — decision gate] **Relay children must run with a FAILING askpass so a sub-process `sudo` can never pop a GUI password prompt** — OBSERVED 2026-07-18 (run relay-20260717-182134-8632): a loderite `execute` child running `npx playwright test` triggered a graphical sudo password dialog (almost certainly Playwright `install-deps` → `sudo apt-get`); the user was prompted and dismissed it. The executor contract's "missing dep → handback, not sudo" is PROSE and cannot stop a *sub-process* from calling `sudo`. Mechanical fix: give every relay child an environment where `sudo` fails INSTANTLY and non-interactively (`SUDO_ASKPASS=/bin/false`, or `sudo` aliased to `-n`), so no dialog ever reaches the user — the child just gets a non-zero exit and hands back the missing dep. <!-- id:eb46 --> — 🚧 GATED (auto, id:3801; route:human): Only reachable env-injection point is ~/.claude/settings.json (relay-untouched); needs the user to add SUDO_ASKPASS=/bin/false there. — needs /relay human
  - **Step 1 — locate the env-injection point (this decides the lane):** find where a relay child inherits its process environment (the pool launch / the harness `agent()` spawn / a wrapper). Set `SUDO_ASKPASS=/bin/false` there. **BAILOUT GUARD:** if the ONLY reachable injection point is `~/.claude/settings.json` `env`, STOP — that file is [INPUT — user] and deliberately untouched by relay work; re-lane this item `[INPUT — user]` with the exact settings.json snippet to add, and hand back. Do NOT edit settings.json from a worktree.
  - **Step 2 (if an in-repo/pool injection point exists):** set it, and verify the child still SURFACES the missing dep in its handback rather than silently swallowing the failure ([[feedback-mechanize-no-swallow-stderr]]).
  - **Done-check**: a child (or a simulation of the child env) whose task shells out to `sudo` gets an immediate non-interactive failure (no GUI prompt) and hands back; `tests/run-tests.sh` still fully green. If Step 1 bails to settings.json, the done-check is the re-lane + handback instead.
  - **Context**: `relay/scripts/relay-loop.js` spawns children via the Workflow `agent()` API (no `process.env` reachable inside the sandbox — see L1907); the env is set at pool launch, OUTSIDE relay-loop.js. A git pre-commit hook does NOT catch this (sudo is runtime, not a git write). Relates id:077d. **JUDGMENT CALL flagged in REVIEW_ME** (env-injection point / possible [INPUT — user] re-lane).
